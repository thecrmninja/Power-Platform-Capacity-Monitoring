# Power Platform Capacity Monitory

This project aims to provide organisations with capacity monitoring across all environments within a Microsoft Power Platform tenant.
<br><br>
Building on top of functionality developed by the Microsoft PowerCAT team for the Power Platform Centre of Excellence toolkit, this will allow organisations to be able to monitor & report on their capacity consumption across all capacity types
<br><br>
The latest version will be available through its direct folder. All previous released will be grouped under a 'Previous Releases' folder.
<br><br>
I will endeavour to ensure that all relevant information is placed in the release notes section. The release is aimed at IT/Power Platform admins, who have the necessary privileges to access the Microsoft CoE toolkit (with all associated security requirements)
<br><br>
If you find any issues, please raise an Issue item with a description. Please also feel free to suggest other functionality to include
