# Power Platform Capacity Monitory

This project aims to provide organisations with capacity monitoring across all environments within a Microsoft Power Platform tenant.
<br><br>
Building on top of functionality developed by the Microsoft PowerCAT team for the Power Platform Centre of Excellence toolkit, this will allow organisations to be able to monitor & report on their capacity consumption across all capacity types
<br><br>
The latest version will be available through its direct folder. All previous released will be grouped under a 'Previous Releases' folder.
<br><br>
I will endeavour to ensure that all relevant information is placed in the release notes section
